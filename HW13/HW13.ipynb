    "**Core Ideas of WaveNet**\n",
    "\n",
    "- WaveNet is an autoregressive deep neural network that generates raw audio sample-by-sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It predicts each audio sample based on all previous ones using a stack of convolutional layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outputs are modeled using a softmax distribution over quantized values (after Âµ-law companding).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture Highlights**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Causal convolutions ensure predictions respect time order (no peeking ahead).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dilated convolutions expand the receptive field efficiently, capturing long-range dependencies without large filters or deep stacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gated activation units (tanh + sigmoid) improve modeling over standard ReLU activations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Residual and skip connections help with training deeper models and improve convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditioning**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Global conditioning adds speaker identity or style as a constant input across time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Local conditioning allows time-varying features like phonemes or pitch to guide the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conditioning is handled through extra convolutional layers that merge with the main signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications and Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text-to-Speech (TTS): WaveNet significantly outperforms LSTM and HMM systems in naturalness (based on human listener ratings).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multi-speaker generation: One model can imitate many different voices by conditioning on speaker IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Music generation: Capable of producing harmonic, realistic musical clips, though sometimes inconsistent across longer time spans.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Speech recognition: WaveNet can be adapted for classification tasks with competitive performance using raw waveforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths and Limitations**\n",
    "- Strengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Operates directly on raw audio.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Highly flexible and powerful generative framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Works well across speech, music, and classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Slow to generate audio due to sample-by-sample nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Needs large receptive fields for long-term structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Training is computationally intensive."
