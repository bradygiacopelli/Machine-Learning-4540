    "### #1 GAN Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- GANs consist of two competing neural networks: a generator (G) and a discriminator (D).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The generator learns to map random noise to data samples, aiming to mimic the real data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The discriminator learns to distinguish between real data and data generated by G.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training is a minimax game: G tries to fool D, while D tries to correctly identify real vs. fake samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The objective function reaches equilibrium when G produces data indistinguishable from the real data, and D outputs 0.5 for all inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In practice, G is updated to maximize log(D(G(z))) for better gradient flow early in training.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No inference or Markov chains are required—sampling is done via forward passes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- GANs can generate sharp, realistic samples, but training can be unstable and requires careful coordination between G and D.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extensions include conditional GANs, semi-supervised learning, and encoder-decoder variants for inference."
